  abstract={Semantic segmentation is a computer vision technique that assigns a distinct class label to every pixel in an image, generating a segmentation map where each pixel belongs to a specific category. This enables various applications, such as automatic and in-depth land cover and land use analysis, tracking urbanization, deforestation, road, and building detection, disaster response, traffic management, city planning, and environmental monitoring. Encoder-decoder-based architectures excel in semantic segmentation tasks than traditional CNN-based methods because they can extract hierarchical features, combine contextual and spatial information, and accurately reconstruct segmentation maps. In this paper, Attention U-Net, where the attention mechanism is introduced to the modified version of U-Net, is implemented for semantic segmentation in satellite images. Instead of just focusing on extracting features, the proposed method emphasizes making accurate segmentation output. The segmentation quality of each model was assessed using performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and IoU score. The findings suggest that the Attention U - Net model surpasses other variations, attaining a higher IoU score of 0.7959 and exhibiting strong segmentation abilities across several land cover categories, such as water bodies, land, roads, buildings, and vegetation. Furthermore, by visual analysis of the results, it becomes apparent that the Attention U-Net is remarkably proficient at accurately capturing intricate details in satellite imagery.},

  abstract={Modern organic farming is gaining popularity in the agriculture of many developing countries. There are many problems arise in farming due to various environmental factors and among these plant leaf disease is considered to be the most strong factor that causes the deficit of agricultural product quality. The goal is to mitigate this issue through computer vision and machine learning technique. This paper proposed a technique for plant leaf disease detection and classification using K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier. The texture features are extracted from the leaf disease images for the classification. In this work, KNN classifier will classify the diseases like alternaria alternata, anthracnose, bacterial blight, leaf spot, and canker of various plant species. The proposed approach can successfully detect and recognize the selected diseases with 96.76 % accuracy.},

  abstract={Bone cancer is one of the most dangerous and leading cause of early death around the globe. Therefore, early detection and classification of the bone tumor have become needed to cure the patient. This study uses a wavelet-based segmentation method for the detection of the bone tumor. The segmented bone tumor part is further processed for the classification purpose. In this study k-nearest neighbour (KNN) classifier is employed for the classification of bone tumor into benign and malignant class. A number of images are collected and gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) features are extracted from these images for the creation of a learned classifier model. The obtained performance of the classification result exhibit that the KNN classifier provides 92.50% accuracy in bone tumor classification.},

  abstract={Brain tumor can cause the creation of most aggressive cancer, with a much shorter life expectancy in most advanced stages, unless identified and treated accordingly. In earlier, radiologists have to manually identify the tumors from MRI images or other imaging types. That is both time consuming and threatening to the misclassification that could affect the recovery plan of a patient. Technological innovations and machine learning assist radiologists to detect tumors without invasive procedures. One of the machine learning algorithms that has been shown to be effective at image segmentation and classification is the convolutional neural network (CNN). In this proposed work, a novel CNN architecture was used on a publicly available figshare dataset to identify three brain tumor types. The proposed CNN architecture outperformed most state-of-the-art approaches, achieving a classification accuracy of 96.90 %. Precision, recall, and F1-score are some of the other evaluation metrics used in the study. In addition, the paper includes an in-depth analysis of misclassifications.},

  abstract={The proposed study investigates dual circular polarization in the X-band (8-12 GHz) frequency range. Using a single input microstrip line feed approach, the design employs three microstrip patches (patch #1, #2, and #3) as an array. The design also incorporates both-sided MIC (microwave integrated circuit) technology, which simplifies the entire procedure. On Advanced Design System (ADS) software, the task is created and simulated with Teflon as a substrate material. The input signal from the input port is eventually routed to three patches using the U-shaped slot with flared arm ends in the ground plane. The meander line in the design is crucial for achieving circular polarization by allowing the phase difference between signals feeding to patches. Without the meander line, the antenna would only emit linear polarization. Left-hand circular polarization is achievable by meandering lines between Patch #1 and #3. Meander lines between the other patches (#1 and #2) gives polarization of other senses (right-hand circular polarization). At 10.05 GHz, the antenna has an axial ratio of 0.26 dB and an axial ratio bandwidth of 140 MHz. The antenna has a maximum gain of 9.5 dBi which is comparatively higher than other array antenna containing more than three elements in the design. The antenna has an impedance bandwidth of 6% for -10 dB return loss. The return loss less than -40 dB indicates that the antenna is properly matched in the resonant frequency.},
